# DiffUI
A simple gui for applying and creating binary patches using bsdiff (http://www.daemonology.net/bsdiff/) rather than xdelta as it creates files 50-80% smaller. Can be downloaded here: https://github.com/TheKodeToad/DiffUI/releases
# Compiling
Run `mvn clean compile assembly:single`.
This will create target/diffui-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar.
